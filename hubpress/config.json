We at The CLEAR Project are a group of young scientists at the University of California, Berkeley who want to find better ways to communicate science at the forefront of discovery. Initially, our focus was to learn from failed attempts to explain GMO technology, but have now expanded our interest beyond agriculture to improving scientific communication in all disciplines to both the public and between areas of scientific study.
